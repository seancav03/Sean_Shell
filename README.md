Shell lab: When you run the program, you will be prompted with '> '. Type your command after this indicator, then press enter. Your processes will be split by |, <, and >. The first word in each process is the command, and all following words are arguments. Words are separated by spaces, unless grouped together with single or double quotes. You will get an error if the quotes don't match. End the program with Cntr C or Cntr D. The Program will split your input into processes and output a string representation of the process objects. Each object has a process number, command, and list of arguments.
